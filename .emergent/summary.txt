The previous AI engineer initiated the FinPercent application, successfully overcoming initial environment setup challenges like missing files and  host blocking, ensuring the preview was accessible. Subsequent work focused on extensive UI/UX enhancements based on explicit user requests. Key accomplishments include: globally changing the app's font to Manrope, significantly improving the Sankey diagram's design with advanced D3.js and animations, reorganizing core navigation for better feature logical grouping, and ensuring design consistency by applying a neomorphic aesthetic across major application pages (Super Features, Stock Market, Profile, Settings, Company Status). The engineer also integrated actual user-provided badge assets for Company Status and implemented a complex badge-to-logo morphing animation on the Dashboard. The immediate task involves refining the badge designs to precisely match new visual references provided by the user, demonstrating a continuous iterative design improvement cycle.

<product_requirements>
The FinPercent application is a comprehensive React-based financial dashboard integrating FastAPI backend and MongoDB. It aims to provide advanced financial management, budgeting, investment tracking, and data visualizations.
**Initial Build & Setup:**
- Display a functional preview of the existing application.
**Design & UI Enhancements:**
- Change the application's global font to Manrope.
- Enhance the design of the Sankey diagram on the dashboard to be more appealing, professional, and interactive.
- Replace existing badges on the Company Status page with animating, appealing, and clean star-based badges, including company names, using provided visual assets.
- Implement a badge-to-FinPercent logo morphing animation on the front page/dashboard upon initial load.
- Ensure design consistency (buttons, animations, overall theming) similar to the Explore page across Super Features pages, Stock Market pages, Profile, Settings, and Company Status pages.
**Feature & Navigation Restructuring:**
- Restructure the Super Features section (Investment Pooling, Automated Banking, Debt Repayment) by nesting them under their corresponding feature categories.
- Reorganize Methods (NWS, STOP, Kakeibo) to be nested under Stock Market as a guide to methods for easier navigation.
**Final Refinement:**
- Make the Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges on the Company Status page exactly like new provided visual references, ensuring precise design matching.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js for UI, Vite for development server, Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations, D3.js for data visualizations (Sankey Diagram).
- **Backend**: FastAPI for API, MongoDB for database.
- **UI/UX**: Neomorphic design principles, responsive design, custom SVG animations.
- **Environment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor for process management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   ****: Critical for frontend server configuration. Modified to add  and a wildcard () to  to resolve preview blocking issues.
-   ****: Global stylesheet. Updated to import 'Manrope' font from Google Fonts and set it as the default  for the HTML and body elements.
-   ****: Tailwind CSS configuration. Modified to configure 'Manrope' as the default sans-serif font, ensuring consistent typography.
-   ****: Responsible for the main dashboard's financial flow visualization. Extensively modified to include custom gradients, premium tooltips, node/link animations, multi-layer backgrounds, status indicators, and a metrics footer.
-   ****: Handles the Investment Pooling feature. Transformed to introduce Asset Gained Pooling and Operations Gained Pooling divisions with tab-based navigation, performance metrics, risk assessment integration (S.T.O.P, Altman Z-score), and an enhanced professional interface using neomorphic elements.
-   ****: Displays company status. Modified to implement card-style badges with wood grain/metallic textures, animated stars (for Gold tier), and particle effects. It leverages . A JSX syntax error was also fixed here.
-   ****: Component for rendering animated company badges. Updated to use the actual SVG image assets (, , ) and implement a 4-phase animation sequence with continuous effects.
-   ****: New files created (, , ) to store the user-provided badge designs as SVG assets for use in the UI.
-   ****: Main application dashboard. Modified to incorporate a revolutionary badge-to-FinPercent logo morphing animation upon initial load, involving rotation, scaling, particle effects, and glow effects, with the Sankey diagram appearing afterward.
-   ****: Manages the application's sidebar and bottom navigation. Reorganized to nest Investment Pooling, Automated Banking, and Debt Repayment under an expandable Super Features section and move NWS, Kakeibo, STOP methods under an expandable Stock Market section as a Guide to Methods. The old Methods section was removed.
-   ****: Stock market analysis page. Enhanced with a new Financial Methods Guide section explaining how methods relate to market analysis, using neomorphic cards and interactive elements.
-   ****: Enhanced with  and  styling, animations, and status badges to match the Explore page's design.
-   ****, ****, ****, ****, ****: All these files and their sub-components were updated to consistently apply the neomorphic design principles, including  and  styling, staggered animations, and status badges to align with the overall application aesthetic.

<pending_tasks>
- The immediate pending task is to ensure the Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges on the Company Status page are precisely re-created and displayed according to the user's latest visual reference.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the focus is on refining the visual design of the company status badges. The previous AI engineer has received new visual references for the Gold, Silver, and Bronze badges and is in the process of ensuring that the rendered badges on the Company Status page () exactly match these new designs. This involves updating the badge assets (likely SVG files in ) and potentially modifying the  component to incorporate any new design nuances, textures, or branding elements provided in the latest reference images. The aim is to achieve pixel-perfect fidelity with the user's desired aesthetic for these critical visual elements.
