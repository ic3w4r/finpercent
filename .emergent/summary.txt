The previous AI engineer meticulously built and enhanced the FinPercent application, starting from environmental setup. Initial efforts focused on UI/UX, implementing a global Manrope font, refining the Sankey diagram, reorganizing navigation, and applying a consistent neomorphic design across key pages. A complex badge-to-logo morphing animation was integrated on the Dashboard, and company status badges were enhanced with user-provided SVG assets and sophisticated animations.

The conversation then shifted to troubleshooting preview access issues, which involved modifying  to allow specific and wildcard hosts. Following this, a major feature request was the implementation of a multi-stage, animated onboarding flow with progress tracking, deeply integrated into the dashboard, requiring new components (, , ). This was further refined to match the application's neomorphic theme.

Subsequent debugging addressed a blank page error due to a missing  (fixed by commenting out  in ), and restoration of missing dashboard content (Sankey diagram) and fixing  styling. A significant new feature, a financial simulation tool, was introduced, allowing users to model changes to KPIs, company status, and Sankey flow. This tool's layout was rearranged to user specifications, and percentage-from-revenue calculations were added.

Finally, the focus shifted to fixing and clarifying method pages under Stock Market and Simulation Tool. The S.T.O.P method was initially misinterpreted as a trading method and later corrected to represent Savings, Taxes, Operations, Profit, with new corresponding method pages and clickable categories in the simulation tool. The current task involves addressing an issue with  not being visible when clicked, indicating a routing problem.

<product_requirements>
The FinPercent application is a React-based financial dashboard with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB, designed for advanced financial management.
**Initial Phase:**
- Display a functional application preview.
- Implement global Manrope font.
- Enhance Sankey diagram design for professionalism and interactivity.
- Replace company status badges with animating, star-based designs from provided SVG assets.
- Integrate a badge-to-FinPercent logo morphing animation on the dashboard.
- Ensure consistent neomorphic design (buttons, animations) across Super Features, Stock Market, Profile, Settings, and Company Status pages.
- Restructure navigation: Investment Pooling, Automated Banking, Debt Repayment under Super Features; NWS, Kakeibo, STOP under Stock Market as a Guide to Methods.
- Refine Gold, Silver, Bronze badges on Company Status page to precisely match visual references.
**New Feature - Onboarding Flow:**
- Implement a multi-stage onboarding process as a continuous scrollable action dialog box.
- Stages (moving bottom-to-top) include: balance sheet upload with progress bar, data extraction for company/user, business type/Udyam Aadhar, essential details.
- Card morphing animation with running status and tick signs for completed stages.
- Progress bar and nudge on the dashboard page.
- Onboarding flow must match existing FinPercent theme.
**New Feature - Simulation Tool:**
- Create a simulation tool showing real-time changes to company status (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and Sankey flow based on user input.
- Rearrange layout: Financial Flow Simulation next to parameter slider, categorize parameters (Savings, Taxes, Operations, Profit). Remove company status impact box.
- Show percentage from revenue for each category and item.
**Fixes/Enhancements - Method Pages:**
- Ensure S.T.O.P and N.W.S method pages are functional and accessible from navigation.
- Clarify S.T.O.P to mean Savings, Taxes, Operations, Profit, and update the page content and related navigation in the simulation tool accordingly.
- Fix  not being visible when clicked, implying a routing issue for dynamic method/category pages.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (animations), D3.js (Sankey Diagram).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **UI/UX**: Neomorphic design, responsive design, custom SVG animations, card morphing, interactive sliders.
- **Routing**: React Router for single-page application navigation and dynamic routes.
- **Context API**: For managing global state like onboarding progress.
- **Environment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor (process management).

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ****: Critical for frontend server configuration. Modified to add  domains and specific proxy service URLs to  for external preview access.
-   ****: Supervisor configuration. Modified to adjust the frontend program's  from  to  to match the actual file structure.
-   ****: Global stylesheet. Configured to import 'Manrope' font and set it as default.
-   ****: D3.js visualization. Modified for gradients, tooltips, animations. Required data props to be passed from .
-   ****: Main navigation. Reorganized to nest Super Features and Stock Market items.  component temporarily commented out to resolve  errors.
-   ****: Main dashboard. Implemented badge-to-logo morphing animation. Integrated  and  components. Adjusted rendering logic to ensure Sankey diagram and other content are visible after initial animation.
-   ****: Displays company status. Updated to use custom SVG badges (, etc.) and .
-   ****: Handles animated company badges. Uses SVG assets and implements 4-phase animation.
-   ****: Custom SVG assets for Gold, Silver, Bronze badges.
-   ****: NEW. Implements the multi-stage, scrollable onboarding process with card morphing animations and progress tracking. Styled to match the neomorphic theme. Fixed  import path.
-   ****: NEW. Displays a persistent nudge on the dashboard to prompt user onboarding. Styled to match the neomorphic theme and removed boundary box. Fixed  import path.
-   ****: NEW. Provides context for onboarding state (e.g., progress, completion status) across the application.
-   ****: Main router. Updated to include routes for onboarding (), new method pages (), and the simulation tool ().
-   ****: NEW. Implements the interactive financial simulation tool. Layout rearranged for side-by-side display of parameters and Sankey. Parameters categorized (Profit, Operations, Savings, Taxes). Includes real-time percentage calculations. Interactive S.T.O.P categories added that link to method pages.
-   ****: NEW. Custom CSS for styling sliders within the simulation tool.
-   ****: NEW.
    -   : Rewritten to focus on Savings, Taxes, Operations, Profit financial management framework.
    -   : Placeholder for N.W.S Method.
    -   : Placeholder for Kakeibo Method.
    -   : NEW. Placeholder for Tax Strategies.
    -   : NEW. Placeholder for Operations Guide.
-   ****: Existing component, currently identified as expecting dynamic routing parameters which are not yet configured.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the  component is correctly integrated and visible when clicked, which involves setting up its dynamic routing in .
- Further testing and refinement of the onboarding flow, simulation tool, and all method pages to ensure full functionality and user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was addressing an issue where the  component, located at , was not visible or accessible when intended.

The investigation has revealed that  is designed to handle dynamic routing, expecting parameters like . However, the current  (the main routing file) does not have these dynamic routes configured. The AI engineer's last action was to inspect the  file to understand its expected inputs and then identify the missing routing setup.

The goal is to correctly configure the routing in  to ensure that when a user interacts with elements that should trigger , it renders correctly with the appropriate context (method and category). This is crucial for completing the interactive S.T.O.P categories in the simulation tool and potentially other areas where detailed method information might be displayed.
